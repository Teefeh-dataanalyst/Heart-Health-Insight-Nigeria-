# Heart-Health-Insight-Nigeria-

# Overview
This project aims to analyze heart health patterns among individuals in Nigeria, focusing on heart rate data from both young and adult populations. The study encompasses a total of 5,000 participants, examining key health factors contributing to heart-related conditions. One of the significant findings indicates that 45.1% of the population studied experienced heart attacks, with cases distributed across male, female, and other gender categories.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to derive insights into heart health trends in Nigeria by analyzing contributing factors such as BMI, health awareness, family history, blood pressure, regions, income level, smoking, and exercise habits. The analysis seeks to answer:

-What are the key risk factors for heart attacks in Nigeria?

-What is the rate of heart attack in adult in comparison with the young ones?

-How do demographic and lifestyle factors influence heart health?

-Is there a correlation between income level and heart-related issues?

-How does heart health awareness impact the likelihood of heart complications?

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of records from 5,000 individuals covering both young and adult populations. The key columns in the dataset include:

-BMI: Body Mass Index of individuals

-Health Awareness: Knowledge and understanding of heart health

-Family History: Presence of heart disease in close relatives

-Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels

-Regions: Geographic location of participants

-Income Level: Socioeconomic status of individuals

-Smoking: Smoking habits (Yes/No)

-Exercise: Frequency of physical activity

-Heart Attack Cases: Indicating whether the individual has had a heart attack

# Methodology
-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing numerical variables, and encoding categorical data.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in heart health, understanding distributions, and identifying risk factors.

-Statistical Analysis & Correlation Study: Examining relationships between different variables and heart attack occurrences.

-Visualization: Building models to predict the likelihood of heart attack cases based on given health factors.

# Key Findings
-45.1% of the population had experienced heart attacks, highlighting a significant public health concern.

-Risk factors such as high BMI, smoking, lack of exercise, and family history showed strong correlations with heart attack cases.

-Income level and regional differences played a role in access to healthcare and heart health awareness.

# Tools Used
Excel(Data cleaning and preprocessing)

Power BI (for dashboards & insights visualization)

SQL (for data querying and manipulation)

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into heart health trends in Nigeria. It highlights the importance of health awareness, lifestyle choices, and medical history in preventing heart-related diseases. The findings can help in designing targeted public health interventions and improving heart disease prevention strategies.

# Recommendation
Expanding the dataset to include more diverse demographics.

Conducting predictive modeling to assess individual risk scores.

Implementing machine learning models to improve heart attack prediction.

Increasing awareness through data-driven health campaigns.
